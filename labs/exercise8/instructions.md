## Prerequisites

**Complete [SETUP.md](../SETUP.md) if not already done.** Exercises can be done in sequence or independently; if independent, ensure SETUP is done and you have the items below.

**Required:**
- On your feature branch (`jsmith` — first initial + last name, lowercase)
- Local dev server at `http://localhost:3000` (if testing locally)
- Code editor open with the repository
- Exercises 1–7 completed (if doing in sequence)
- DA.live access
- AEM Sidekick logged in (for Site Admin tool auth)
- **Personal workspace**: your own site `cloudadoption/jsmith-mc` (use your name, lowercase)

**Verify you're on your branch**: `git branch` → should show `* jsmith` (your name).

## What You'll Learn

- How repoless architecture works in Edge Delivery Services
- How to share code across multiple sites (one codebase, many sites)
- How to use the Site Admin tool to clone site configurations
- How to use DA.live Traverse and Import tools to copy content
- How to create your own branded site in minutes
- How multi-brand theming works with body class selectors and CSS custom properties
- How Configuration Service manages code and content separation

---

## Why This Matters

**The scenario**: NYC Masterclass is successful. You need to launch personal regional events or client sites with the same functionality.

**The problem**: Do you duplicate the entire codebase for each site? Fork the repo? Copy all blocks?

**The repoless solution**:
- **One code repository** (blocks, scripts, styles) - `cloudadoption/nycmasterclass`
- **Multiple sites** with different content - Each person's site in DA.live
- **Configuration Service** manages which code repo each site uses
- **Code updates** to `nycmasterclass` apply to all sites automatically
- **Zero code duplication** - Launch new sites in minutes

**Multi-brand theming**:
- Same code, different visual identities per site
- CSS custom properties scoped to body classes
- Theme applied via metadata — no code changes needed per site

**Benefits**:
- Maintain code once → all sites get updates instantly
- Launch new sites in minutes (not hours or days)
- Consistent functionality and quality across sites
- Bug fixes apply everywhere automatically
- Each site can have its own visual identity

---

## Understanding Repoless

### Traditional Model (Without Repoless)
```
NYC Masterclass
├── GitHub: cloudadoption/nycmasterclass (code)
└── DA.live: cloudadoption/nycmasterclass (content)

Boston Masterclass
├── GitHub: cloudadoption/boston-mc (code - DUPLICATED!)
└── DA.live: cloudadoption/boston-mc (content)

Chicago Masterclass  
├── GitHub: cloudadoption/chicago-mc (code - DUPLICATED!)
└── DA.live: cloudadoption/chicago-mc (content)
```

**Problem**: Update the hero block? Must change 3 GitHub repositories. Bug fix? Deploy to 3 places.

### Repoless Model (With Configuration Service)
```
CODE (ONE place)
GitHub: cloudadoption/nycmasterclass
├── blocks/
├── scripts/
└── styles/

CONTENT (MANY places)
DA.live Projects (each uses nycmasterclass code):
├── cloudadoption/nycmasterclass (NYC content)
├── cloudadoption/boston-mc (Boston content)
├── cloudadoption/chicago-mc (Chicago content)
└── cloudadoption/jsmith-mc (YOUR content)
```

**Solution**: Update hero block once in `nycmasterclass` → all 4 sites get it instantly.

**Reference**: [Repoless Architecture](https://www.aem.live/docs/repoless)

---

## How It Works

### The Configuration Service

Each site in DA.live can specify:

1. **Content Source**: Where content lives (always the DA.live project itself)
2. **Code Source**: Where code lives (can point to a different GitHub repo)
3. **Site Settings**: Permissions, custom configuration

**Example**: Your site `cloudadoption/jsmith-mc`
- Content from: `cloudadoption/jsmith-mc` in DA.live (YOUR pages)
- Code from: `cloudadoption/nycmasterclass` in GitHub (SHARED blocks/scripts)

### What Gets Loaded From Where

When someone visits `https://main--jsmith-mc--cloudadoption.aem.page/`:

1. EDS checks `jsmith-mc` configuration → sees code source is `nycmasterclass`
2. Gets **content** (index.html) from `cloudadoption/jsmith-mc` in DA.live
3. Gets **code** (hero.js, hero.css, scripts.js) from `cloudadoption/nycmasterclass` in GitHub
4. Combines them → your page with your content, shared functionality

**Reference**: [Configuration Service Setup](https://www.aem.live/docs/config-service-setup)

---

## Step 1: Clone the Site Configuration

The Site Admin tool lets you clone an existing site's configuration to create a new site instantly.

1. Open **Site Admin**: [https://tools.aem.live/tools/site-admin/index.html](https://tools.aem.live/tools/site-admin/index.html)

2. **IMPORTANT**: You must be logged in via AEM Sidekick extension first

3. In the form:
   - **Organization**: `cloudadoption`
   - Click **List** to load the existing configuration

4. Clone the configuration for `nycmasterclass` to create your new site (click the three dots icon from the site card, then choose "clone site config"):
   - **New site name**: `jsmith-mc` (your first initial + last name + `-mc`)
   - Example: John Smith → `jsmith-mc`, Sarah Johnson → `sjohnson-mc`

5. Confirm the clone

**What you just did**: Created a new site entry in the Configuration Service that inherits the basic configuration from `nycmasterclass` — including the code source. Your new site already knows to load code from the shared `nycmasterclass` repository.

---

## Step 2: Create Your Content Folder

Now create a place for your site's content in DA.live.

1. Go to DA.live: [https://da.live/#/cloudadoption](https://da.live/#/cloudadoption)

2. You should see the `cloudadoption` org with its existing sites (including `nycmasterclass`)

3. Create a new folder called `jsmith-mc` (your name)

**Result**: You now have an empty content folder at `cloudadoption/jsmith-mc`.

---

## Step 3: Copy Content from NYC Masterclass

Instead of creating content from scratch, use the DA.live tools to copy all existing content from the NYC Masterclass site.

### 3a: Traverse the Source Site

1. Open the **Traverse** tool: [https://da.live/apps/traverse](https://da.live/apps/traverse)

2. Enter the source site path: `cloudadoption/nycmasterclass`

3. Run the traverse — this crawls the site and builds a list of all content pages and assets

4. Wait for it to complete

5. Hit `Copy List` to grab all the page URLs

### 3b: Import Content to Your Site

1. Open the **Import** tool: [https://da.live/apps/import](https://da.live/apps/import)

2. Paste all the URLs gathered from the traverse tool into the `By URL` field.

3. In the `Into` section, enter the org `cloudadoption` and your site name: `jsmith-mc`

4. Run the import — this copies all content (pages, images, metadata) to your site

5. Wait for it to complete

6. When the import finishes, click the **Copy Success** button to copy all the successfully imported URLs to your clipboard — you'll need these in the next step

### 3c: Preview & Publish All Content

Imported content needs to be previewed and published before it's available on your site.

1. Open the **Bulk Operations** tool: [https://da.live/apps/bulk](https://da.live/apps/bulk)

2. Paste the URLs you copied from the import tool

3. Run **Preview** to generate preview versions of all pages

4. Wait for it to complete, then run **Publish** to make all pages live

**Result**: Your site now has a full copy of all NYC Masterclass content, previewed and published.

---

## Step 4: Preview Your Site

1. Open your site: `https://main--jsmith-mc--cloudadoption.aem.page/`

2. **Test on desktop and mobile**: Use Chrome DevTools responsive view (F12 → device toolbar Cmd+Shift+M / Ctrl+Shift+M) to verify the site at different widths.

3. **You should see**: The full NYC Masterclass homepage — same hero, same cards, same styling

**What's happening**:
- **Content** is coming from `cloudadoption/jsmith-mc` (your DA.live folder)
- **Code** is coming from `cloudadoption/nycmasterclass` (shared GitHub repo)
- The site looks identical to NYC because you copied the content and share the code

---

## Step 5: Verify Repoless is Working

Prove that code is loading from the shared repository, not your site.

1. On your site (`https://main--jsmith-mc--cloudadoption.aem.page/`), open browser **DevTools** (F12)

2. Go to the **Network** tab

3. Refresh the page

4. Filter by **JS** or **CSS** and look at the file URLs

**You should see**:
```
https://main--nycmasterclass--cloudadoption.aem.page/blocks/hero/hero.js
https://main--nycmasterclass--cloudadoption.aem.page/scripts/scripts.js  
https://main--nycmasterclass--cloudadoption.aem.page/styles/styles.css
```

**KEY OBSERVATION**: URLs say `nycmasterclass`, NOT `jsmith-mc`!

**This proves**:
- Your **content** comes from `cloudadoption/jsmith-mc` (your DA.live project)
- Your **code** comes from `cloudadoption/nycmasterclass` (shared GitHub repo)
- **Repoless is working!**

---

## Step 6: Customize Your Content

Now make the site yours by editing content. This proves that each site's content is independent.

1. In DA.live, navigate to your site: [https://da.live/#/cloudadoption/jsmith-mc](https://da.live/#/cloudadoption/jsmith-mc)

2. Open the homepage (`index`)

3. Change the `<h1>` to: **Jsmith's Masterclass** (use your name)

4. DA.live auto-saves. Click **Preview** to see the page.

**Verify**:
- Your site (`jsmith-mc`) shows YOUR heading
- NYC site (`nycmasterclass`) still shows the original heading
- Both sites have identical styling, blocks, and functionality

**This proves**: Content is completely independent between sites while all code is shared.

---

## Step 7: Multi-Brand Theming

Your site works, but it looks identical to NYC Masterclass. In a real multi-brand setup, each site needs its own visual identity. You'll add a custom theme using **body class selectors** — one of the simplest approaches to multi-brand theming.

**Reference**: [Multi-Brand EDS Implementation Using Repoless](https://main--helix-website--adobe.aem.page/drafts/ravuthu/multi-brand-eds-implementation-using-repoless#option-1-single-file-with-body-class-selectors)

### How Themes Work

1. Authors set a `theme` value in page metadata (e.g., `theme: masterclass`)
2. The `decorateTemplateAndTheme()` function in `aem.js` reads this value and adds it as a class on `<body>`
3. CSS rules scoped to `body.masterclass` apply the visual identity
4. Different sites set different theme values → different visual identities from the same CSS file

The NYC Masterclass site currently uses `theme: masterclass`, which produces the orange/purple gradient. You'll create your own theme.

### 7a: Set Your Theme via the Metadata Sheet

In AEM Edge Delivery Services, **bulk metadata** lets you set default metadata values for all pages on a site using a spreadsheet. This is how you apply a theme site-wide without editing every page individually.

1. In DA.live, navigate to your site: [https://da.live/#/cloudadoption/jsmith-mc](https://da.live/#/cloudadoption/jsmith-mc)

2. Open the **sheet** called `metadata` at the root of your site

3. Set up the sheet with these columns and values:

| URL | theme |
|-----|-------|
| `/**` | `jsmith` |

- The `URL` column uses glob patterns to match pages — `/**` matches every page on the site
- The `theme` column sets the metadata value that `decorateTemplateAndTheme()` reads

4. DA.live auto-saves. **Preview** the metadata sheet so it becomes available as JSON.

**What this does**: Every page on your site now has `theme: jsmith` in its metadata. The `decorateTemplateAndTheme()` function in `aem.js` reads this value and adds `class="jsmith"` to the `<body>` element. No page-level editing needed — one sheet controls the entire site.

> **Tip**: Bulk metadata is a powerful tool beyond theming. You can set any metadata key (title, description, og:image, template, etc.) for groups of pages using URL patterns like `/blog/**` or `/events/**`.

### 7b: Add Your Theme CSS

On your branch, add a new theme in `styles/styles.css`. Add this **after** the existing `body.masterclass` rule:

```css
body.jsmith {
  --brand-1: #06b6d4;
  --brand-2: #2563eb;
  background: radial-gradient(1200px 600px at 80% -10%, #06b6d4 0%, transparent 60%),
              radial-gradient(900px 600px at 10% 10%, #2563eb 0%, transparent 60%),
              linear-gradient(180deg, var(--masterclass-bg-2), var(--masterclass-bg-1) 55%);
  background-attachment: fixed;
  color: var(--ink);
}
```

> **Use your name** as the class name (e.g., `body.sjohnson`, `body.kwang`). Pick any colors you like!

**What this does**:
- Overrides `--brand-1` (accent color used in cards, links, eyebrows) from orange to cyan
- Overrides `--brand-2` (secondary accent) from purple to blue
- Changes the background gradient to match the new brand colors
- All blocks that use `var(--brand-1)` and `var(--brand-2)` automatically pick up the new colors

### 7c: Test Locally

Before pushing, test your theme locally. Use the `--pagesUrl` flag to tell the local dev server to load **content** from your new site while using your **local code**:

```bash
aem up --pagesUrl https://main--jsmith-mc--cloudadoption.aem.page/
```

Replace `jsmith-mc` with your site name.

Open `http://localhost:3000/` and **you should see**:
- Your site's content (your custom heading from Step 6)
- Your new theme colors applied (cyan/blue instead of orange/purple)
- The full site running with your local code + your remote content

**This is a key repoless development pattern**: run local code against any site's content for testing.

> **Pro tip**: You can run both sites in parallel by using the `--port` flag. In one terminal run the original site (`aem up`) on the default port 3000, and in another run your new site on a different port:
> ```bash
> aem up --port 3001 --pagesUrl https://main--jsmith-mc--cloudadoption.aem.page/
> ```
> Now compare `http://localhost:3000/` (original) and `http://localhost:3001/` (your theme) side by side.

### 7d: Push Your Changes

```bash
git add styles/styles.css
git commit -m "feat: add personal theme for jsmith-mc"
git push origin jsmith
```

Replace `jsmith` with your branch name.

### 7e: Verify Your Theme

Open your site: `https://jsmith--jsmith-mc--cloudadoption.aem.page/`

**You should see**:
- Your custom heading ("Jsmith's Masterclass")
- Your custom brand colors (cyan/blue instead of orange/purple)
- Same blocks, same layout, same functionality — your content with your visual identity

**Compare with NYC**: Open `https://main--nycmasterclass--cloudadoption.aem.page/` side by side. Same codebase, different content, different brand.

If this was a real project, at this point, you'd raise a pull request to merge `jsmith` into `main` and once completed, you'd have a basic multi-brand setup powered by a singular codebase.

### Why This Approach Works

From the [multi-brand theming guide](https://main--helix-website--adobe.aem.page/drafts/ravuthu/multi-brand-eds-implementation-using-repoless#option-1-single-file-with-body-class-selectors):

> The simplest approach is to define all brand variables in one file, scoped by body class.

```
styles/styles.css
├── :root { ... }              ← Shared base variables
├── body.masterclass { ... }   ← NYC Masterclass theme (orange/purple)
├── body.jsmith { ... }        ← Your theme (cyan/blue)
├── body.sjohnson { ... }      ← Another participant's theme
└── ...                        ← Add more themes as needed
```

Each site's metadata controls which theme class is applied. **No code changes needed** to launch a new brand — just set the metadata and add a CSS rule.

---

## Step 8: Explore Other Participants' Sites

Ask other participants to share their site URLs and compare.

**What you'll notice**:
- All sites have different content (names, headings)
- All sites have different brand colors (if they completed the theming step)
- All sites use the same blocks and functionality
- All sites load code from `nycmasterclass` (check DevTools Network tab)

**Result**: Multiple unique branded sites from one codebase!

---

## Key Benefits of Repoless

**For developers**:
- Fix bug once → all sites get fix instantly
- Add feature once → all sites get feature immediately
- One codebase to maintain (not 10 or 100)
- Centralized testing and quality control
- No code duplication or version drift

**For content authors**:
- Each site has own DA.live project (zero conflicts)
- No code complexity (pure content authoring)
- Full editorial control per site
- Site-specific branding via metadata

**For organizations**:
- Launch new sites in minutes (not days or weeks)
- Consistent functionality and quality across all sites
- Reduced maintenance overhead (1x effort, Nx sites)
- Scale to hundreds or thousands of sites effortlessly
