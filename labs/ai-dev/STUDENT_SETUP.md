# AI-Assisted Development — Student Setup

**Lab setup:** [../SETUP.md](../SETUP.md)

Complete **Steps 1–7** (clone, branch, AEM CLI, dependencies, lint, dev server, and **Step 7: AI Coding Agent Setup**). That is enough for the AI lab; you do not need DA or EDS access for Day 1 because the lab uses only local content and the dev server (the agent creates test pages in `drafts/tmp/`).

For Day 2 hands-on exercises, complete the rest of SETUP.md (Steps 8–11 and the full validation checklist).
