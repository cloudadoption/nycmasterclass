## Prerequisites

**Complete [Lab Setup](../SETUP.md) through Step 7 before starting.**

- AI coding agent installed and authenticated (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, or GitHub Copilot)
- Dev server running: `aem up --html-folder drafts`
- `localhost:3000` open in browser
- Terminal visible alongside editor

> **No agent set up?** You can follow along by watching the instructor's demo. The concepts and prompting patterns transfer to any AI coding tool.

## What You'll Learn

- How AI coding agents work with Edge Delivery Services
- How to use an AI agent to orient yourself in an unfamiliar codebase and research before building
- Two approaches to building blocks: one-shot vs plan mode
- How to use an agent for code review
- How context (AGENTS.md, skills, prompts) shapes agent output

## Part 1: Experience Modernization Agent

*Demo Only*

The [Experience Modernization Agent](https://aemcoder.adobe.io/) is Adobe's AI-powered console for modernizing web experiences with Edge Delivery Services. It migrates content and styles from existing sites, connects to your GitHub repo, and provides a built-in code editor with preview — all in the browser.

---

## Part 2: Orient

Before building anything, it can be helpful to use the agent to orient yourself in the project. These three steps show examples of how to explore an unfamiliar codebase and research existing solutions.

---

### Step 1: What Does the Agent Know?

Ask the agent what it knows about this project and what tools it has.

**Prompt:** Use [**2.1** from Prompts.md](Prompts.md#21--what-do-you-know-about-this-project)

**What to look for:**
- The agent describes the tech stack, project structure, and coding conventions — it read AGENTS.md
- It surfaces available skills and explains when you'd use them
- Key skills to note:
  - `content-driven-development` — the workflow for building blocks
  - `block-collection-and-party` — research tool for finding reference implementations
  - `docs-search` — searches AEM documentation
- Everything the agent knows here is project-level — a different project would produce a completely different response

---

### Step 2: Research Before You Build

Before building new blocks, check if reference implementations already exist.

**Prompt:** Use [**2.2** from Prompts.md](Prompts.md#22--research-before-you-build)

**What to look for:**
- The agent reaches for the block-collection-and-party skill on its own — you didn't tell it to
- It searches for speakers and schedule references and reports what it finds
- It maps existing blocks to your needs (e.g., "cards" as a starting point for speakers)
- Even if there's no exact match, the agent researched before proposing to build from scratch

---

### Step 3: Code Comprehension + Documentation

Ask the agent to tour the project's blocks and check them against AEM best practices.

**Prompt:** Use [**2.3** from Prompts.md](Prompts.md#23--code-comprehension--documentation)

**What to look for:**
- The agent reads local block files to explain what each one does
- It fetches AEM documentation from aem.live to identify gaps and best practices
- It links to relevant docs — students can follow the links later
- The agent pulled from multiple sources (local code + external docs) without being told which tools to use

---

## Part 3: Build

Two blocks, same Content Driven Development (CDD) workflow, different levels of control. The CDD skill orchestrates the full process: content model, test content, implementation, and validation.

---

### Step 4: Build a Speakers Block (One-Shot)

Hand the agent the goal and let it run the workflow. It decides the content model, creates test content, writes JS and CSS, and validates. The agent may pause to confirm decisions along the way — that's normal. Use your best judgement: approve and let it continue, or steer if something looks off.

**Prompt:** Use [**3.1** from Prompts.md](Prompts.md#31--speakers-block-one-shot)

**What happens:**
1. The agent invokes the CDD skill
2. It designs a content model (how authors will structure the block)
3. It creates test content at `drafts/tmp/speakers.plain.html`
4. It implements `blocks/speakers/speakers.js` and `blocks/speakers/speakers.css`
5. It validates — linting, self-review

**When it finishes**, open `http://localhost:3000/drafts/tmp/speakers` to see the result.

**What to evaluate:**
- Does the content model make sense for authors?
- Does the block render correctly?
- What looks right? What would you question?

---

### Step 5: Build a Schedule Block (Plan Mode)

Same CDD workflow, but this time you review the plan before any code is written. This is a good approach for complex tasks or unfamiliar territory.

**Prompt:** Use [**3.2** from Prompts.md](Prompts.md#32--schedule-block-plan-mode)

The agent will propose a content model and approach before writing any code. Review it — does the content model make sense for authors? Would you change anything? Approve (or steer) before letting it proceed with the full CDD workflow.

**When it finishes**, open `http://localhost:3000/drafts/tmp/schedule` to see the result.

---

## Part 4: Review

### Step 6: Agent Code Review

The agent built both blocks — now ask it to review its own work against project conventions.

**Prompt:** Use [**4.1** from Prompts.md](Prompts.md#41--code-review)

**What to look for:**
- The agent reads both blocks and compares them
- It flags inconsistencies (naming, structure, CSS patterns) between the two blocks
- It checks against AGENTS.md conventions (CSS scoping, responsive design, accessibility)
- It fixes what it finds — refresh the browser to see updates
- This works on any code, not just code the agent wrote — you can also point it at a PR link to review teammate code
