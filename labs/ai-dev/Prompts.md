# AI-Assisted Development — Prompts

---

## Part 1 — Experience Modernization Agent

---

### 1.1 — Migrate a page

```
Let's migrate https://summit.adobe.com/na/ to /drafts/shsteimer/summit.
Match the original design as close as possible, but with our color scheme.
```

---

## Part 2 — Orient

---

### 2.1 — What do you know about this project?

```
What do you know about this project and what tools do you have to help me
work on it?
```

---

### 2.2 — Research before you build

```
I need to build a speakers block and a schedule block for this site.
What's already out there that we can borrow or steal as a starting point?
```

---

### 2.3 — Code comprehension + documentation

```
Give me a quick tour of the blocks in this project. Then check the AEM
docs — what best practices should we be following that we're not? Link me
to the relevant documentation.
```

---

## Part 3 — Build

---

### 3.1 — Speakers block (one-shot)

```
I need a speakers block for displaying conference speaker cards with a
headshot, name, role, and bio.
```

---

### 3.2 — Schedule block (plan mode)

```
Let's make a plan to build a schedule block for displaying a conference agenda
with time slots, session titles, speakers, and a track or room. The content
model here could get complex, so think it through carefully and let's review
before we kick off the CDD process.
```

---

### 4.1 — Code review

```
Before we open a PR, let's run a code review on both the speakers and
schedule blocks.
```
